Unsecured personal loans are those that aren't backed by any collateral. This means that your lender can't repossess your assets if you fail to pay back the loan, but also that the lender is taking a larger risk on you. For that reason, you'll typically need a higher credit score or have to pay a higher interest rate in order to get an unsecured hardship loan.
Secured Hardship Personal Loans

Secured hardship personal loans, in contrast, are those that are backed by collateral. This makes them less risky for lenders, who can then offer them to customers with bad credit or give customers with good credit a lower interest rate. If you can't qualify for an unsecured personal loan, a secured hardship loan could be a good option. Compare the rates offered by the best lenders to see which is best for you.
