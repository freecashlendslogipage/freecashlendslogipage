Hardship loans work much like other types of personal loans. You'll apply for the loan, usually online. If your application is approved, the lender will send you money in a lump sum, typically within a few days.

You then have to repay that money, typically in equal monthly installments, over several months or several years. In addition, you'll pay interest on the loan and sometimes fees.
