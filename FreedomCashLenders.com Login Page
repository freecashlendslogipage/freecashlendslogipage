 The exact definition of a hardship loan can vary from one lender to another. Typically, hardship loans are similar to personal loans, but they tend to have low loan limits, relatively low interest rates, and short repayment terms because they are designed to get you out of immediate financial trouble.

Smaller banks and credit unions are more likely to offer a hardship loan, and you'll generally have to prove that you are facing genuine financial difficulties to access them.

If you're approved, you can use a hardship loan for a variety of purposes, such as to meet obligations like medical bills, to make other loan payments, or simply to pay everyday living expenses.
